# Cybersecurity Threats Analysis
## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing cybersecurity threat data from 2015 to 2024. Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to analyze the data and create visualizations that help understand the various patterns of cyber attacks.

## Objective
The project aims to understand the impact of cyber attacks on different industries over the years and analyze their financial impact. It also investigates the response time to mitigate incidents and identifies the most frequent types of attacks.

## Technologies Used
Pandas for loading and analyzing the data.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations.

Python for data processing and analysis.

## Analysis Steps
Data Loading: The data is loaded from a CSV file containing details of cybersecurity incidents.

Data Exploration: The general structure of the data is examined, and checks are made to ensure no missing values.

Basic Analysis:

Analyzing the number of incidents per year.

Identifying the most frequent attack types.

Analyzing the most targeted industries.

Identifying the top 10 countries most affected by cyber incidents.

Visualizations: Several plots are created to represent the data visually, including:

The number of incidents per year.

The distribution of attack types.

The most targeted industries.

Financial impact of cyber attacks.

Distribution of incident resolution times.

## Visualizations Created
Cybersecurity Incidents Per Year: A line plot showing the number of cybersecurity incidents that occurred each year.

Most Frequent Attack Types: A bar plot showing the frequency of attack types such as Ransomware and Phishing.

Most Targeted Industries: A bar chart displaying the industries that were most affected by cyber threats.

Top 10 Most Affected Countries: A bar chart showing the 10 countries most affected by cyber attacks.

Financial Impact of Cybercrime: A bar chart showing the total financial loss due to cyber incidents over the years.

Incident Resolution Time Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of response times in hours to resolve incidents.
